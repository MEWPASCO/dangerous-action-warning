# Installing it to your Discord

Use [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord) or an equivalent client mod that allows you to install themes.

Paste the following link into your online theme links:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MEWPASCO/dangerous-action-warning/refs/heads/main/danger
```

### Other method 
Paste this into your QuickCSS (Or any non-Vencord equivalent) to make it a little easier:
> [!NOTE]
> Must be at the top of your code, @import does not work otherwise - this is for all the @import code you might have - put it to the top!  
```
/* dangerous css */
@import url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MEWPASCO/dangerous-action-warning/refs/heads/main/danger');
```

Alternatively if your client does not support online themes you can download the theme file found in this repository and put it into your theme folder.
